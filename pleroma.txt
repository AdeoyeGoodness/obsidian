The School of Artificial Intelligence & Robotics (SOAIR), a leader in affordable tech education and
robotics development in Nigeria, proposes a strategic partnership with Pleroma Inc. to develop its
innovative Petri net-based cybersecurity software. Pleroma’s unified framework, which uses Petri
nets to model organizational networks, detect cyber threats via machine learning trained on the
CAPEC database, and optimize defenses through stochastic game theory, addresses the critical
need for compositional cybersecurity in an interconnected world. SOAIR offers its expertise in
software development, AI, and project-based training to build a scalable, intuitive platform that
aligns with Pleroma’s vision. This collaboration will deliver a prototype within six months, leveraging
SOAIR’s cost-effective development model and Pleroma’s cutting-edge research to create a market-
ready solution that protects small and large firms from diverse cyber threats. Proposal from SOAIR to Pleroma Inc. for Cybersecurity Software Development
SOAIR, operating under Learners Technology NIG LTD, is a trailblazing institution dedicated to
empowering Africans through affordable education in AI, robotics, and coding. Since 2021, SOAIR
has trained over 500 Nigerians and engaged 2,500+ young learners through its Code Learners
initiative. Key strengths include:
Software Development Expertise: SOAIR’s team has delivered robust web and AI applications,
including student accommodation software and robotics control systems.
Project-Based Approach: Hands-on training ensures practical, industry-relevant solutions, with
students contributing to real-world projects.
Affordable Innovation: SOAIR’s cost-effective model makes high-quality tech solutions
accessible, aligning with Pleroma’s goal of affordable consulting for SMEs.
Robotics and AI Leadership: SOAIR manufactures Africa-centric robotics, equipping its team
with skills in concurrent systems akin to Petri net modeling.
SOAIR’s experience in developing scalable software and fostering tech talent positions it as an ideal
partner to bring Pleroma’s cybersecurity vision to life.Executive Summary
About SOAIR
Pleroma Inc. aims to revolutionize cybersecurity by using Petri nets a graphical and mathematical
language for concurrent systems to provide a unified framework for detecting and preventing
cyberattacks. Key components include:
Network Modelling: Creating Petri net models from business process data to represent
organizational systems and their interactions.
Threat Detection: Using machine learning trained on the CAPEC database to identify attack
patterns and assign costs to network nodes.
Defence Optimization: Applying stochastic game theory and reinforcement learning to
simulate attack scenarios and devise optimal protection strategies.
Compositional Security: Modeling small and large firms independently and combining them to
address interdependencies, critical for supply chains.
Intuitive Interface: Translating complex models into diagrams for non-experts, ensuring
accessibility.
Pleroma’s current priorities include developing a prototype, scaling from toy models to realistic
scenarios, and integrating cloud-based computing for performance. SOAIR’s proposal addresses
these needs with a structured development plan. Understanding Pleroma’s Vision
Cybercrime costs Canada $3.12 billion annually and globally extracts 13-20% of the $3 trillion
internet economy, with SMEs facing significant risks (average data breach cost: $6.03 million). The
cybersecurity market is projected to reach $177 billion by 2025, driven by rising threats like
ransomware, phishing, and IoT vulnerabilities. Pleroma’s Petri net approach is uniquely positioned
to:
Address the gap in unified cybersecurity frameworks, unlike fragmented tools.
Serve SMEs, which account for 98% of Canada’s economy and 75% of data breaches.
Capitalize on the 1.8 million global cybersecurity job gap by offering intuitive tools for non-
experts.
SOAIR’s development capabilities will accelerate Pleroma’s market entry, delivering a solution that
meets the growing demand for compositional, scalable cybersecurity.Market Opportunity
